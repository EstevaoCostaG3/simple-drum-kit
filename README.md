# simple-drum-kit
This is a simple drum kit project that I made to begin learning Javascript. You can play it by pressing some keys in the keyboard which are indicated in the simple drum kit page: https://estevaocostag3.github.io/simple-drum-kit/.
This project is based on the first project of the Javascript30 course, which is available at https://JavaScript30.com.

## What I have learned
- How to use events and listeners in JavaScript to make the drums' sound good and the key's animation persistent.
